### The challenge

If you look in the designs folder, you'll see that the challenge was to create a hover action in the paragraph in the middle. I could have done it statically using just CSS to just take the screenshots, but I decided to create a very simple javascript document to create a fully functional hover function.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Helped me with general queries and as reference to check syntax for coding.
